# Active Context: Documentation Crawler

## Current Status
The project has a fully functional implementation with the following features:
- BFS crawling of documentation sites
- Content filtering (LLM and heuristic)
- Directory structure preservation
- Environment variable configuration
- Enhanced console logging with progress bars
- Real-time crawling statistics
- Successful testing with gluestack.io documentation

## Recent Changes
1. Enhanced Logging Implementation
   - Added progress bars for batch processing
   - Implemented real-time statistics tracking
   - Added URL processing status indicators
   - Improved error reporting

2. Testing with gluestack.io
   - Successfully crawled documentation
   - Verified directory structure preservation
   - Validated content filtering
   - Confirmed proper handling of internal links

## Current Focus
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Design rate limiting system
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Implement retry mechanism with backoff

2. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Implement comprehensive error recovery
   - Add retry mechanism for failed URLs
   - Design backoff strategy for rate limits

## Active Decisions
1. **Rate Limiting Strategy**
   - Design adaptive rate limiting based on server response
   - Implement configurable limits per domain
   - Add automatic backoff on 429 responses

2. **Memory Management**
   - Implement dynamic batch size adjustment
   - Add memory usage monitoring
   - Optimize URL queue management

## Next Steps
1. Performance Optimization
   - Implement rate limiting system
   - Add retry mechanism with backoff
   - Optimize memory usage

2. Error Handling
   - Design comprehensive error recovery system
   - Implement URL retry queue
   - Add detailed error reporting

3. Future Improvements
   - Add site-specific configuration support
   - Implement custom content filters
   - Create API interface for programmatic usage
