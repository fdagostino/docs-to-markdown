# Active Context: Documentation Crawler

## Current Status
The project has a fully functional implementation with the following features:
- BFS crawling of documentation sites
- Content filtering (LLM and heuristic)
- Directory structure preservation with named documentation folders
- Environment variable configuration (MAX_DEPTH, OUTPUT_DIR)
- Enhanced console logging with progress bars
- Real-time crawling statistics
- Successful testing with gluestack.io documentation

## Recent Changes
1. **Script Renaming and Configuration**
   - Renamed script to docs-to-markdown.py
   - Moved depth and output configuration to .env
   - Added --doc_name parameter for documentation organization
   - Updated directory structure to support multiple documentations

2. **Enhanced Logging Implementation**
   - Added progress bars for batch processing
   - Implemented real-time statistics tracking
   - Added URL processing status indicators
   - Improved error reporting

3. **Testing with gluestack.io**
   - Successfully crawled documentation
   - Verified directory structure preservation
   - Validated content filtering
   - Confirmed proper handling of internal links

## Current Focus
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Design rate limiting system
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Implement retry mechanism with backoff

2. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Implement comprehensive error recovery
   - Add retry mechanism for failed URLs
   - Design backoff strategy for rate limits

## Active Decisions
1. **Configuration Strategy**
   - MAX_DEPTH and OUTPUT_DIR moved to .env for centralized configuration
   - Added --doc_name parameter for better organization
   - Support for multiple documentation sets in output directory

2. **Memory Management**
   - Implement dynamic batch size adjustment
   - Add memory usage monitoring
   - Optimize URL queue management

## Next Steps
1. Performance Optimization
   - Implement rate limiting system
   - Add retry mechanism with backoff
   - Optimize memory usage

2. Error Handling
   - Design comprehensive error recovery system
   - Implement URL retry queue
   - Add detailed error reporting

3. Future Improvements
   - Add site-specific configuration support
   - Implement custom content filters
   - Create API interface for programmatic usage
