# docs-to-markdown üöÄ | Convert online documentation into Markdown by simply providing a URL

Perfect for converting APIs docs, libraries docs, SDKs docs, and any other type of tech documentation for use with LLMs, AI Agents, Cursor, Tailwind, Cline, etc.

## What is docs-to-markdown?  
docs-to-markdown is a simple and fast tool that crawls online documentation from a given URL and converts it into Markdown files. 
Just provide the URL of the documentation you want to convert, and the tool will handle the rest. 
Whether you need a single consolidated file or multiple files, it streamlines your workflow for feeding content into your LLM and optimizing your AI prompts.

## Features ‚ú®  
- **Flexible Conversion:** Convert documentation into one file or split into multiple files based on your needs.
- **Intelligent Filtering:** Extract only the sections you need to include in your LLM's context.
- **AI-Optimized:** Tailored for seamless integration with LLMs, AI Agents, and other AI systems.
- **User-Friendly:** Easy-to-use commands and a straightforward interface for quick results.

## Installation üíª  
Install directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install docs-to-markdown
```

## Usage üöÄ  
The tool provides flexible options for converting online documentation to Markdown format:

### Basic Usage
```bash
docs-to-markdown https://example.com/docs --doc_name example_docs
```

### With LLM Filtering (using GPT-4)
```bash
docs-to-markdown https://example.com/docs --llm-filtering --doc_name example_docs
```
Note: When using `--llm-filtering`, you need to set your OpenAI API key via:
- Command line: `--openai-key "sk-..."`
- Environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `.env` file

### Output Options
Generate multiple files (preserving site structure):
```bash
docs-to-markdown https://example.com/docs --doc_name example_docs --output multiple
```

Generate a single consolidated file:
```bash
docs-to-markdown https://example.com/docs --doc_name example_docs --output single
```

### Additional Parameters
- `--max_depth`: Maximum crawling depth (default: 2)
- `--output_dir`: Output directory (default: current directory)
- `--llm-filtering`: Use GPT-4 to filter and clean content
- `--openai-key`: OpenAI API key for LLM filtering

The tool will create a directory named by your `doc_name` parameter containing the Markdown files.

## Development üõ†Ô∏è

### Developer Setup
