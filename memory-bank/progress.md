# Progress Tracking: Documentation Crawler

## What Works
1. **Core Functionality**
   - [x] BFS crawling implementation
   - [x] Content filtering (basic)
   - [x] Directory structure preservation
   - [x] Environment variable configuration
   - [x] Command line interface
   - [x] Enhanced console logging with progress bars
   - [x] Real-time crawling statistics
   - [x] URL processing status tracking

2. **Project Setup**
   - [x] Virtual environment
   - [x] Git repository
   - [x] Dependencies installation
   - [x] Browser automation setup
   - [x] Memory Bank initialization

## In Progress
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Rate limiting implementation
   - [ ] Memory usage optimization
   - [ ] Retry mechanism for failed URLs

2. **Testing**
   - [x] Gluestack documentation crawling
   - [x] Content filter validation
   - [x] Directory structure verification

## Known Issues
1. **Error Handling**
   - Need better error recovery
   - Missing retry mechanism
   - Need to implement backoff strategy

2. **Performance**
   - No rate limiting
   - Memory usage could be optimized
   - Need to implement concurrent batch size adjustment

## Planned Features
1. **Short Term**
   - Enhanced console logging
   - Better error handling
   - Rate limiting implementation

2. **Medium Term**
   - Retry mechanism for failed URLs
   - Site-specific configurations
   - Performance optimizations

3. **Long Term**
   - Custom content filters
   - API interface
   - Configuration profiles

## Milestones
1. **Version 0.1**
   - [x] Basic crawling
   - [x] Content filtering
   - [x] Directory structure

2. **Version 0.2** (Completed)
   - [x] Enhanced logging
   - [x] Error handling
   - [x] Testing with gluestack

3. **Version 0.3** (Planned)
   - [ ] Rate limiting
   - [ ] Retry mechanism
   - [ ] Performance improvements
